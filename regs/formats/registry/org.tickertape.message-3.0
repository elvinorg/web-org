Tickertape messages provide the user-to-user chat interaction
component of Tickertape.
%%
org.tickertape.message
int32
M
Major protocol version.  Must have a value of "3" for this specification.
%%
minor
int32
M
Minor protocol version.  Must have a value of "0" for this specification.
%%
to
string
M
The name of the destination group. Must use a fully-qualified name. 

An alternative would be to use Usenet-style names: dstc.chat.hq, but
again, these should be based on domain names to guarantee uniqueness.

Note that this field has been renamed from previous versions (was
TICKERTAPE).
%%
message
string
M
The text body of the message.

Note that this field has been renamed from previous versions (was
TICKERTAPE).
%%
from
string
M
The unique identifier for the sender. This may be either the user's
(canonical) email address or an anonymous string (provided it is
guaranteed to be unique).
%%
name
string
O
A user-friendly name for the sender. If this field is not provided,
client programs should present the full value of the from field.

The intention of this field is to support more nicknames, without fear
of collision with the real from name.  Client applications should
present a nickname if one is provided.
%%
message-id
string
M
Unique identifier for this message.  Any value will do, and it's not
strictly necessary that it be globally unique for all time.  We should
probably set some guidelines here ...
%%
in-reply-ro
string
O
Identifier of message for which this is a reply.
%%
reply-to
string
O
Name of group to which replies should be directed, if not the group of
the current message.  Used to redirect conversations, typically out of
a public forum.
Note that this relies on clients having an ability to dynamically
adjust their subscription to follow such conversations.
%%
replace
string
O
Identifier of a replaceable message.  Clients should check their
display for another message with this identifier, and if present,
replace it with the current message.

Note that both the name and semantics of this field have changed.  The
value should be the message-id of the message to be replaced.  Unlike
the previous scheme, this enables replacement of arbitrary messages.
%%
mime-version
string
O
The MIME specification requires that a version number be provided.
This value should be set to "1.0" for this specification.
%%
content-type
string
O
MIME type of the attachment content.
%%
content-transfer-encoding
string
O
MIME encoding of the attachment content.
%%
content-disposition
string
O
MIME disposition of the attachment content.
%%
attachment
opaque
O
Byte string containing the content of an attachment.  No encoding is
required for the content, and producers should be careful to remove
any encoding from attachments received from other sources (ie. BASE64
encoded email).

if no content-type field is present, this field should be ignored.
%%
lifetime
int32
O
Default lifetime of the message, in minutes.  Clients should remove
the message from their display after this duration (unless locally
overridden).
