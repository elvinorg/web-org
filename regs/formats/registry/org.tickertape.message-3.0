Tickertape messages provide the user-to-user chat interaction
component of Tickertape.
%%
org.tickertape.message
int32
M
Protocol version.  Must have a value of 3000 for this specification.
%%
Group
string
M
The name of the destination group. Must use a fully-qualified name. 

An alternative would be to use Usenet-style names: dstc.chat.hq, but
again, these should be based on domain names to guarantee uniqueness.

Note that this field has been renamed from previous versions (was
TICKERTAPE).
%%
Message
string
M
The text body of the message.

Note that this field has been renamed from previous versions (was
TICKERTAPE).
%%
From
string
M
The unique identifier for the sender. This may be either the user's
(canonical) email address or an anonymous string (provided it is
guaranteed to be unique).
%%
name
string
O
A user-friendly name for the sender. If this field is not provided,
client programs should present the full value of the from field.

The intention of this field is to support more nicknames, without fear
of collision with the real from name.  Client applications should
present a nickname if one is provided.
%%
Message-Id
string
M
Unique identifier for this message.  Any value will do, and it's not
strictly necessary that it be globally unique for all time.  We should
probably set some guidelines here ...
%%
In-Reply-To
string
O
Identifier of message for which this is a reply.
%%
Thread-Id
string
O
When sending a message to a group to which the sender is not
subscribed but wishes to see any replies, this field should be set
(and the sender's user agent should alter its subscription so as to
receive any messages with this Thread-Id value).

This value must be globally unique.  See Message-Id for
recommendations.
%%
Replaces
string
O
Identifier of a replaceable message.  Clients should check their
display for another message with the same value for this field, and if
present, replace it with the current message.
%%
Attachment
string
O
Byte string containing the content of an attachment.  The content must
be a legitimate UTF-8 string, which will require 7bit encoding for
binary data.

The MIME versions, content type, transfer encoding, etc, are all
included within this string, as per the MIME standards.
%%
Timeout
int32
O
Default lifetime of the message, in minutes.  Clients should remove
the message from their display after this duration (unless locally
overridden).
%%
User-Agent
string
O
Name and version information for the user agent (program) generating
this message.
%%
No-Archive
int32
O
The sender of a message can request that it not be archived by setting
this attribute with a non-zero value.
%%
Distribution
string
O
A value, intended for interpretation by forwarding filters at
administrative boundaries, describing restrictions on the distribution
of this message.

No constraints are set on the value of this field, except that it
SHOULD have a string value.
