Stations inside a building are of most use to those who use the
building, as they reflect the climate control of the building more
than the prevailing weather conditions. For this reason, the location
field should be particularly descriptive for internal reports.

One use of the internal reporting format is for feedback in climate
control systems. In order to support this, the location, floor and
room attributes should be carefully specified.
