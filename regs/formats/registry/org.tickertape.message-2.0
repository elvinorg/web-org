Tickertape messages provide the user-to-user chat interaction
component of Tickertape.
%%
org.tickertape.message
int32
M
Major protocol version.  Must have a value of "2" for this specification.
%%
minor
int32
M
Minor protocol version.  Must have a value of "0" for this specification.
%%
group
string
M
The name of the destination group. Must use a fully-qualified name. 

An alternative would be to use Usenet-style names: dstc.chat.hq, but
again, these should be based on domain names to guarantee uniqueness.
%%
message
string
M
The text body of the message.
%%
id
string
M
The unique identifier for the sender. This may be either the user's
(canonical) email address or an anonymous string (we suggest a string
representation of a UUID, although this does reveal the Ethernet
address of the sending machine).
%%
name
string
O
A user-friendly name for the sender. If this field is not provided,
the program should use the full value of the id field.
%%
message-id
string
M
Unique identifier for this message.  Any value will do, and it's not
strictly necessary that it be globally unique for all time.  We should
probably set some guidelines here ...
%%
in-reply-ro
string
O
Identifier of message for which this is a reply.
%%
followups-to
string
O
Name of group to which replies should be directed, if not the group of
the current message.  Used to redirect conversations, typically out of
a public forum.
Note that this relies on client's having an ability to dynamically
adjust their subscription to follow such conversations.
%%
replace
string
O
Identifier of a replaceable message.  Clients should check their
display for another message with this identifier, and if present,
replace it with the current message.

Used to continuously update a message without filling the display.
%%
mime-type
string
O
MIME type of the attachment content.
%%
attachment
opaque
O
Byte string containing the content of an attachment.  No encoding is
required for the content, and producers should be careful to remove
any encoding from attachments received from other sources (ie. BASE64
encoded email).

if no mime-type field is present, this field should be ignored.
%%
lifetime
int32
O
Default lifetime of the message, in minutes.  Clients should remove
the message from their display after this duration (unless locally
overridden).
