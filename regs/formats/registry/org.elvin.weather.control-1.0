Control messages configure the station's sending of reports. For each
observed attribute, the magnitude which is considered significant can
be set.  Additionally, minimum and maximum times between reports can
be configured which override the individual significance setting.

Control messages can be applied to stations selected by identifier
(which restricts you to a single station), or by specifying ranges of
latitude, longitude and altitude. With the use of the Elvin 4 security
mechanism, only authorised control messages will be accepted.
